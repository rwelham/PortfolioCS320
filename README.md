In this class we learned a bit about the job of a QA engineer and how to effectively write our own unit tests that provided good coverage and explanations for the code. To ensure that a program is functional and secure, the different pieces of the program need to be tested for both. Making sure that all of the methods and classes within a program are working as intended can be done with unit testing. Security testing is important for keeping in mind how someone might manipulate or break a program. This must be kept in balance with user requirements being a top priority. If the user isn't happy with the program they won't use it, but if their requirements are going to break a function or security, it can be tricky. 
My approach for designing software is looking at all of the requirements and making a checklist, whether physical or mental, for the requirements. I go through and work on each requirement and bit while doing some manual testing and then go into unit testing for pieces when I get them finished.
